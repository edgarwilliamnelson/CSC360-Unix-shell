Simple Unix Shell program written for CSC 360 at the University of Victoria that achieved a grade of 100%.

This assignment was focused on gaining experience with process creation and management. As such this shell implementation reads user commands and spawns processes to execute them, along with supporting output redirection for the result of these commands and piping of the output between commands.
