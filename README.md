# Unix Shell

Unix Shell program written for CSC 360 at the University of Victoria. Achieved a grade of 100%.

This shell implementation reads user commands and spawns processes to execute them, along with supporting output redirection and piping between commands. 

This program is written in C99. A text file titled '.sh360rc' must be contained in its directory. The first line of '.sh360rc' should contain the prompt given to the user for input, and the following lines must contain absolute paths to directories containing the binaries for commands the shell is expected to execute, with each path on its own line.
